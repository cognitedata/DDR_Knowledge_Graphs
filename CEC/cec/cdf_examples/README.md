# CDF Examples
There are two different example scripts in here, both were used to help Partners learn how to pull and ingest data from/to CDF.

Timeseries example: This was created for and sent to WindSim. This shows how to pull assets from cdf - specifically for Humboldt Bay - and it shows how to pull and ingest time series and datapoints.

Sequences example: This was created for and sent to EDR Medeso. This shows how to create a sequence and ingest rows to the sequence.
